        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>Always do it on my own
            So I gotta get through it
            And the only thing I know
            Is to love what I'm doing
            Never give up, never slow
            Till I finally prove it
            Never listen to the no's
            I just wanna keep moving
            Keep my head up when I act
            Head up, that's a fact
            Never looking back
            I'ma keep myself on track
            Keep my head up, staying strong
            Always moving on
            Feel I don't belong
            Tell my thoughts to move along
            Push myself to be the best
            Die with no regrets
            Live with every breath
            See my message start to spread
            And I have so many dreams
            Then you hit your teens
            Life ain't really what it seems
            Try to find out what it means
            Always do it on my own
            So I gotta get through it
            And the only thing I know
            Is to love what I'm doing
            Never give up, never slow
            Till I finally prove it
            Never listen to the no's
            I just wanna keep moving
            Yeah, I put out all this art
            It's my only medicine, yeah
            Everything I do
            I'm just being genuine, yeah
            I'm sick of being screwed
            Feel my own adrenaline, yeah
            I do just what I do
            And I hope you let me in, let me in, yeah
            I'm grateful, oh yeah
            Able, oh yeah
            I'm stable, oh yeah
            No label, oh yeah
            You know me, I have
            Only a path
            I'm lonely, but damn
            I'm going to win, yeah
            I don't want no fake love
            I want the real stuff
            Everybody listen up
            'Cause I'll only say it once
            I'm gon' show you all the path
            If you want it bad
            I'm gon' show you where it's at, yeah
            How you can get it back, yeah
            'Cause I ain't never done
            I'll be number one
            Working hella hard
            Until I get just what I want, yeah
            Rise just like the sun, yeah
            Fatal like a gun
            Shooters gonna shoot
            And I'm gon' shoot until I've won, yeah
            Always do it on my own
            So I gotta get through it
            And the only thing I know
            Is to love what I'm doing
            Never give up, never slow
            Till I finally prove it
            Never listen to the no's
            I just wanna keep moving
            Yeah, I put out all this art
            It's my only medicine, yeah
